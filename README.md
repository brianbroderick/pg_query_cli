## pg_query_cli

This is a cli wrapper for the normalization function of the excellent [pg_query_go](https://github.com/brianbroderick/pg_query_cli/tree/master/vendor/github.com/lfittl/pg_query_go) Go package. 

Assuming that your Go workspace is set up, run `go build`. If not, first visit [Golang](https://golang.org/) to set it up.
Building the file may take a couple of minutes because it's compiling parts of the PG lib. Once it's done, you can run it like this:

`./pg_query_cli "SELECT character FROM cartoons WHERE phrase = 'zoinks' OR phrase = 'ruh roh' LIMIT 10"`

It will return the normalized version. i.e. values will be converted to question marks like this:

`SELECT character FROM cartoons WHERE phrase = ? OR phrase = ? LIMIT ?`

This is helpful when aggregating query stats like long running queries, frequently used queries, etc.  It's important to note that it uses the actual PostgreSQL server source to parse SQL queries and return the internal PostgreSQL parse tree. 

FYI, there's an MRI specific Ruby gem at [pg_query](https://github.com/lfittl/pg_query).
